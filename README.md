# **HOTEL BOOKING DATA: PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS FOR OPEN-ENDED CASE STUDY**

Welcome to the Hotel Booking Data Predictive Analysis project! This project aims to harness machine learning techniques to analyze hotel booking data, predict trends, and derive actionable insights.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to utilize a dataset containing hotel booking information to perform data analysis and predictive modeling. You will explore the data, formulate problems, apply machine learning algorithms, and generate a well-documented report summarizing your findings and recommendations.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project environment and start working with the dataset:

### 1. Open the Colab Notebook

Access the Colab notebook to begin your analysis. You can either open it directly or download it using the link below:

[Open Colab Notebook](www.google.com)
[Open Dataset](www.google.com)


### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

For consistent development and execution, we recommend creating a Conda virtual environment. Navigate to your project directory and run the following command to create a new environment:

```bash
conda create --name hotel_booking_analysis python=3.8 -y
```

Activate the virtual environment with:

```bash
conda activate hotel_booking_analysis
```

### 3. Install Required Packages

Ensure that all necessary Python packages are installed. Execute the following command to install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Train the Model

Run the Colab notebook to process the data and train the predictive model. The notebook is designed to automatically save the trained model as a pickle file in the current directory. Ensure you select the appropriate kernel corresponding to the virtual environment you created.

## Deliverables

- **Colab Notebook**: A comprehensive notebook showcasing data understanding, analysis, problem formulation, and modeling techniques.
- **Final Report**: A detailed report summarizing the findings, insights, and recommendations derived from the analysis.
